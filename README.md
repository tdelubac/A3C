# Welcome to A3C

This is an implementation of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm. The code is a modification of the code written by Jarom√≠r Janish on its <a href="https://jaromiru.com/2017/03/26/lets-make-an-a3c-implementation/"excellent blog post about A3C</a>. It is intended to learn to play to the CartPole-v0 game of <a href=https://gym.openai.com/envs/>OpenAI gym</a>. 

## Requirements

You will need TensorFlow, Keras and gym to run the code. To install all the required library simply go in the A3C directory and type in a terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

To run the code go in the A3C directory and type in a terminal:
